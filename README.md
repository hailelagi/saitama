Explore the original game of [Tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) via a cli binary in rust, go or zig and learn to build networked services along the way :)

# Scope
- supports playing a game of tic tac toe in two modes
- easy is a random choice algorithm
- hard is an optimal min-max/alpha-beta pruned search tree decision
- playable with another player over a network (design up in the air but clients should talk to each other)
- multiple clients in go, zig & rust
